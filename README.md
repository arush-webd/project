Explanation:
Classes and Structure:

Train: Represents a train with details like number, name, timings, compartments, and fares.
Ticket: Represents a ticket with a unique PNR, associated train, and list of passengers.
TicketManager: Manages booking and display of tickets.
TrainManager: Manages storage and retrieval of trains.
RailwaySystem: Main interface to interact with users, displaying menus, and handling user choices.
Functionality:

Train Management: Ability to add trains, view all trains, and search trains by number.
Ticket Booking: Allows users to book tickets for a selected train, add passengers, and generate a PNR.
Ticket Display: Shows all booked tickets with details.
User Interface:

Menu: Displays a menu with options to view trains, book tickets, view booked tickets, and exit.
Input Handling: Safely handles user inputs, validates train numbers, and manages passenger details.
Extensibility:

The system can be extended with additional features like ticket cancellation, fare calculation, database integration for persistent storage, and more complex train schedules.
Improvements:

Error handling and input validation can be enhanced for robustness.
Database integration using file handling can be extended to use more advanced database systems like SQLite for scalability.
This expanded example provides a foundational structure for a railway management system in C++, demonstrating OOP principles, file handling, and user interaction. Depending on specific project requirements, further enhancements and features can be added to meet real-world needs in railway administration.
